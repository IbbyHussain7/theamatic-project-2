            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <div class="setup">
                <p><strong>Players:</strong> 3 to 6 players.</p>
                <p><strong>The Board:</strong> The game board represents a mansion with various rooms, hallways, and
                    secret
                    passages.</p>
                <p><strong>Character Tokens:</strong> Each player selects a character and places the corresponding token
                    on
                    the "Start" square.</p>
                <p><strong>Weapon Cards:</strong> There are six weapon cards (Candlestick, Dagger, Lead Pipe, Revolver,
                    Rope, and Wrench).</p>
                <p><strong>Room Cards:</strong> There are nine room cards (Kitchen, Ballroom, Conservatory, Dining Room,
                    Lounge, Hall, Study, Library, and Billiard Room).</p>
                <p><strong>Murder Mystery Envelope:</strong> The game involves secret information, so three cards—one
                    for
                    the character, one for the weapon, and one for the room—are randomly placed into a confidential
                    envelope
                    at the start. This envelope holds the solution to the mystery.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <div class="gameplay">
                <h4>1. Rolling the Dice</h4>
                <p>Players take turns rolling two dice to move around the board. The roll determines how many spaces you
                    move, either horizontally or vertically, along the board’s pathways.</p>

                <h4>2. Moving Around the Board</h4>
                <p>Players can move through rooms by rolling the dice. To enter a room, you don’t need to roll exactly
                    the
                    number of spaces required; you can stop at the room door if your roll would take you past the room.
                </p>
                <p>You can also move through corridors, but cannot move diagonally or through walls. Secret passages
                    (between the study and the lounge, and between the conservatory and the kitchen) allow players to
                    move
                    between rooms more quickly.</p>

                <h4>3. Making Suggestions (Accusations)</h4>
                <p>When you land in a room, you can make a suggestion to try and figure out which character committed
                    the
                    murder, what weapon was used, and which room the crime took place in.</p>
                <p>A suggestion involves the following: Choose one of the weapons from the game and suggest that the
                    murder
                    happened in the room you're currently in (e.g., "I suggest it was Professor Plum in the Study with
                    the
                    Dagger").</p>
                <p>Other players then take turns to disprove your suggestion. If another player has one of the cards you
                    named (i.e., the suspect, weapon, or room), they must secretly show it to you. If they don’t have
                    any of
                    the cards, the next player tries to disprove the suggestion.</p>

                <h4>4. Making an Accusation</h4>
                <p>At any time during the game, you can make an accusation. This is your final guess about the murderer,
                    the
                    weapon, and the room.</p>
                <p>If you make a correct accusation, you win the game! If your accusation is incorrect, you are
                    eliminated
                    from the game but must still show cards to disprove suggestions from other players. Players continue
                    to
                    play until someone makes the correct accusation.</p>

                <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
                <p>The game ends when a player makes a correct accusation and reveals the contents of the envelope. The
                    player who correctly solves the murder is the winner!</p>

                <h3>General Game Rules</h3>
                <p><strong>Turning Over Cards:</strong> Players should keep their cards secret and not show them to
                    others
                    unless they are disproving a suggestion.</p>
                <p><strong>Movement Limitations:</strong> Players can only move into rooms by exact dice rolls, or by
                    choosing to stay in their position and make a suggestion.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Keep track of the cards you’ve seen and heard about throughout the game to
                    narrow down your deductions. Observing other players' suggestions and the cards they show you can
                    give
                    you clues about the murder mystery.</p>
